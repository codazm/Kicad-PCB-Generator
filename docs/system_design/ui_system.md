# UI System Design

## Overview
The UI system is designed to provide both CLI and GUI interfaces for the KiCad PCB Generator. It follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension and maintenance.

## Core Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic is separated from business logic
2. **Consistency**: Common UI patterns and behaviors across interfaces
3. **Accessibility**: Support for different user needs and preferences
4. **Responsiveness**: UI should remain responsive during long operations
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery paths

## Architecture

### UI Manager
```python
@dataclass
class UIManager:
    """Manages UI state and coordination"""
    current_view: str
    views: Dict[str, 'View']
    event_handlers: Dict[str, List[Callable]]
    
    def register_view(self, view_name: str, view: 'View') -> None:
        """Register a new view"""
        pass
    
    def switch_view(self, view_name: str) -> None:
        """Switch to a different view"""
        pass
    
    def register_event_handler(self, event: str, handler: Callable) -> None:
        """Register an event handler"""
        pass
```

### View Interface
```python
@dataclass
class View:
    """Base class for all views"""
    name: str
    layout: 'Layout'
    
    def render(self) -> None:
        """Render the view"""
        pass
    
    def handle_event(self, event: 'Event') -> None:
        """Handle UI events"""
        pass
    
    def update(self, data: Any) -> None:
        """Update view with new data"""
        pass
```

### Event System
```python
@dataclass
class Event:
    """Base class for UI events"""
    type: str
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime
    
    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Serialize event to dictionary"""
        pass

@dataclass
class EventBus:
    """Manages event distribution"""
    handlers: Dict[str, List[Callable]]
    
    def publish(self, event: Event) -> None:
        """Publish an event"""
        pass
    
    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, handler: Callable) -> None:
        """Subscribe to an event type"""
        pass
```

## CLI Interface
```python
@dataclass
class CLIView(View):
    """Command-line interface view"""
    command_parser: 'CommandParser'
    
    def parse_command(self, command: str) -> Command:
        """Parse user command"""
        pass
    
    def display_help(self) -> None:
        """Display help information"""
        pass
    
    def display_error(self, error: str) -> None:
        """Display error message"""
        pass
```

## GUI Interface
```python
@dataclass
class GUIView(View):
    """Graphical user interface view"""
    window: 'Window'
    widgets: Dict[str, 'Widget']
    
    def create_widget(self, widget_type: str, **kwargs) -> Widget:
        """Create a new widget"""
        pass
    
    def layout_widgets(self) -> None:
        """Layout widgets in the window"""
        pass
```

## Common Components

### Layout System
```python
@dataclass
class Layout:
    """Manages UI layout"""
    elements: List['UIElement']
    
    def add_element(self, element: 'UIElement') -> None:
        """Add element to layout"""
        pass
    
    def remove_element(self, element_id: str) -> None:
        """Remove element from layout"""
        pass
    
    def update_layout(self) -> None:
        """Update layout calculations"""
        pass
```

### Widget System
```python
@dataclass
class Widget:
    """Base class for UI widgets"""
    id: str
    type: str
    properties: Dict[str, Any]
    
    def render(self) -> None:
        """Render the widget"""
        pass
    
    def handle_event(self, event: Event) -> None:
        """Handle widget events"""
        pass
```

## Design Assumptions
1. UI will need to support both CLI and GUI interfaces
2. UI will need to handle real-time updates
3. UI will need to support different themes and styles
4. UI will need to handle errors gracefully
5. UI will need to support internationalization
6. UI will need to be responsive and performant

## Next Steps
1. Implement UI Manager
2. Create base View class
3. Implement Event System
4. Create CLI interface
5. Create GUI interface
6. Implement common components
7. Add theme support
8. Add internationalization
9. Add error handling
10. Add performance optimizations

## Notes
- This design is subject to change based on Phase 1 requirements
- Focus on creating flexible interfaces that can be extended
- Document any assumptions that might need to be revised
- Regular synchronization with Phase 1 work is essential
- Consider accessibility requirements early in the design
