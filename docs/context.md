# Project Context (Updated)

## Current State
- The KiCad PCB Generator for Modular Synths is a modular, extensible tool for automating and validating modular synth PCB designs in KiCad 9.
- The validation system has been enhanced with specialized modules for:
  - Signal integrity validation (impedance, crosstalk, reflections)
  - Power/ground validation (power supply, ground plane, decoupling)
  - EMI/EMC validation (emissions, immunity, shielding)
- The test suite has been reorganized for better maintainability:
  - Unit tests for individual validation modules
  - Integration tests for module interactions
  - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Comprehensive documentation is available for:
  - API reference
  - Testing strategy
  - Best practices
  - Usage examples

## Next Steps
1. **Validation System**
   - Add more specialized validation rules for audio circuits
   - Implement real-time validation feedback
   - Enhance error reporting and suggestions

2. **Testing**
   - Increase test coverage for edge cases
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement automated test reporting

3. **Documentation**
   - Add more usage examples
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Document common validation issues

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize validation algorithms
   - Implement parallel processing
   - Add result caching

## Success Criteria
1. **Validation**
   - All validation modules passing tests
   - Comprehensive coverage of audio-specific requirements
   - Clear error messages and suggestions

2. **Testing**
   - High test coverage (>90%)
   - All tests passing
   - Performance within acceptable limits

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Clear usage examples
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

4. **Performance**
   - Validation time < 5s for typical boards
   - Memory usage < 500MB
   - Real-time feedback < 100ms
