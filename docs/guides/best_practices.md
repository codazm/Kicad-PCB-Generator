# Best Practices Guide

## General Best Practices

- **Keep Your KiCad Updated:** Always ensure that you are using the latest version of KiCad to take advantage of new features and bug fixes.
- **Use Version Control:** Utilize version control systems like Git to manage your project files. This allows you to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Document Your Work:** Maintain clear documentation for your projects, including schematics, layouts, and any custom components or libraries.

## Validation Best Practices

- **Run Validation Regularly:** Make it a habit to run the validation checks regularly during the design process to catch issues early.
- **Address Warnings Promptly:** Do not ignore warnings. Address them as soon as possible to prevent potential issues later.
- **Use Detailed Messages:** Take advantage of the detailed messages provided by the validation system to understand the context of each issue.

## UI Best Practices

- **Familiarize Yourself with the UI:** Spend time exploring the user interface to understand its features and capabilities.
- **Use Filtering and Sorting:** Utilize the filtering and sorting options to manage large sets of validation results effectively.
- **Export Results:** Regularly export validation results for documentation and sharing with team members.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Validation Results:** Failing to address validation issues can lead to costly mistakes in the final product.
- **Overlooking Documentation:** Not referring to the documentation can result in missed features or incorrect usage.
- **Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** Use consistent naming conventions for components and nets to avoid confusion and errors.

## Examples

### Example 1: Running Validation

```python
from kicad_pcb_generator.audio.validation.schematic.validator import EnhancedAudioSchematicValidator

# Create an instance of the validator
validator = EnhancedAudioSchematicValidator()

# Run the validation
results = validator.validate_schematic()

# Display the results
for result in results:
    print(f"Severity: {result.severity}")
    print(f"Message: {result.message}")
    print(f"Suggestion: {result.suggestion}")
    print(f"Documentation: {result.documentation_ref}")
    print("---")
```

### Example 2: Using the UI

```python
from kicad_pcb_generator.audio.validation.ui.validation_result_display import EnhancedValidationResultDisplay

# Create an instance of the display
display = EnhancedValidationResultDisplay()

# Display the validation results
display.display_results(results)
```
